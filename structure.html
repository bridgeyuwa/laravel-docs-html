<p><a name="introduction"></a> ## Introduction</p>
<p>The default Laravel application structure is intended to provide a great starting point for both large and small applications. Of course, you are free to organize your application however you like. Laravel imposes almost no restrictions on where any given class is located - as long as Composer can autoload the class.</p>
<p><a name="the-root-directory"></a> ## The Root Directory</p>
<p>The root directory of a fresh Laravel installation contains a variety of folders:</p>
<p>The <code>app</code> directory, as you might expect, contains the core code of your application. We'll explore this folder in more detail soon.</p>
<p>The <code>bootstrap</code> folder contains a few files that bootstrap the framework and configure autoloading, as well as a <code>cache</code> folder that contains a few framework generated files for bootstrap performance optimization.</p>
<p>The <code>config</code> directory, as the name implies, contains all of your application's configuration files.</p>
<p>The <code>database</code> folder contains your database migration and seeds. If you wish, you may also use this folder to hold an SQLite database.</p>
<p>The <code>public</code> directory contains the front controller and your assets (images, JavaScript, CSS, etc.).</p>
<p>The <code>resources</code> directory contains your views, raw assets (LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript), and localization files.</p>
<p>The <code>storage</code> directory contains compiled Blade templates, file based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework. This folder is segregated into <code>app</code>, <code>framework</code>, and <code>logs</code> directories. The <code>app</code> directory may be used to store any files utilized by your application. The <code>framework</code> directory is used to store framework generated files and caches. Finally, the <code>logs</code> directory contains your application's log files.</p>
<p>The <code>tests</code> directory contains your automated tests. An example <a href="https://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a> is provided out of the box.</p>
<p>The <code>vendor</code> directory contains your <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a> dependencies.</p>
<p><a name="the-app-directory"></a> ## The App Directory</p>
<p>The &quot;meat&quot; of your application lives in the <code>app</code> directory. By default, this directory is namespaced under <code>App</code> and is autoloaded by Composer using the <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/">PSR-4 autoloading standard</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>app</code> directory ships with a variety of additional directories such as <code>Console</code>, <code>Http</code>, and <code>Providers</code>. Think of the <code>Console</code> and <code>Http</code> directories as providing an API into the &quot;core&quot; of your application. The HTTP protocol and CLI are both mechanisms to interact with your application, but do not actually contain application logic. In other words, they are simply two ways of issuing commands to your application. The <code>Console</code> directory contains all of your Artisan commands, while the <code>Http</code> directory contains your controllers, middleware, and requests.</p>
<p>The <code>Events</code> directory, as you might expect, houses <a href="/docs/%7B%7Bversion%7D%7D/events">event classes</a>. Events may be used to alert other parts of your application that a given action has occurred, providing a great deal of flexibility and decoupling.</p>
<p>The <code>Exceptions</code> directory contains your application's exception handler and is also a good place to stick any exceptions thrown by your application.</p>
<p>The <code>Jobs</code> directory, of course, houses the <a href="/docs/%7B%7Bversion%7D%7D/queues">queueable jobs</a> for your application. Jobs may be queued by your application or run synchronously within the current request lifecycle.</p>
<p>The <code>Listeners</code> directory contains the handler classes for your events. Handlers receive an event and perform logic in response to the event being fired. For example, a <code>UserRegistered</code> event might be handled by a <code>SendWelcomeEmail</code> listener.</p>
<p>The <code>Policies</code> directory contains the authorization policy classes for your application. Policies are used to determine if a user can perform a given action against a resource. For more information, check out the <a href="/docs/%7B%7Bversion%7D%7D/authorization">authorization documentation</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Many of the classes in the <code>app</code> directory can be generated by Artisan via commands. To review the available commands, run the <code>php artisan list make</code> command in your terminal.</p>
